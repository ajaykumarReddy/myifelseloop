  <h1>The New KeyValuePipe in Angular</h1>

  <p>Angular 6.1 has been released and shipped with new feature called KeyValue Pipe operator.</p>

  <p>As we all know that we cant iterate Objects using the *NgFor directive directly but now we have an pipe operator called
    "keyValue" , with help of this pipe we can easly iterate javascript Objects and Maps.
  </p>

  <p>without wasting time on theory lets get start with examples code</p>

  <p>Lets see how we can use it:</p>

  <app-pre-code [code]="objCode"></app-pre-code>
  <p>Letâ€™s see how we can use it with Map.</p>
  <app-pre-code [code]="mapCode"></app-pre-code>
  <p>By default, the output array will be ordered by keys. Here are examples of arrays that were created based on the default
    alphanumerical order:</p>

  <app-pre-code [code]="sampleCode"></app-pre-code>
  <p>But you can always override that by passing a compareFn as the second input, if you need a custom ordering.</p>
  <app-pre-code [code]="orderCode"></app-pre-code>
